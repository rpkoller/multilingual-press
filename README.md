Create a fast translation network on WordPress multisite.

## Description

Run each language in a separate site, and connect the content in a lightweight user interface. Use a customizable widget
to link to all sites.

This plugin lets you connect an unlimited amount of sites with each other.
Set a main language for each site, create relationships (connections), and start writing. You get a new field now to
create a linked post on all the connected sites automatically.
They are accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch back and forth to translate them.

In contrast to most other translation plugins there is **no lock-in effect**: When you disable our plugin, all sites
will still work as separate sites without any data-loss or garbage output.

Our **Language Manager** offers 174 languages, and you can edit them.

We cannot guarantee free ad hoc support. Please be patient, we are a small team.
You can follow our progress and development notices on our
[developer blog](http://make.marketpress.com/multilingualpress/).

## Features

and themes, navigation menus, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.
- Synchronized trash: move all connected post to trash with one click.

## WPML to MultilingualPress

If you would like to switch from the WPML plugin to MultilingualPress, you can use the helping hands of
[WPML to MultilingualPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpml-to-multilingualpress/). This plugin converts posts from
an existing WPML multilingual site via XLIFF export/import for MultilingualPress.

## Installation and prerequisites

### Requirements

* WordPress Multisite 4.0+.
* PHP 5.2.4, newer PHP versions will work faster.

### Installation

Use the installer via back-end of your install or ...

1. Unpack the download-package.
2. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Network/Plugins** menu in WordPress and click **Network Activate**.
4. Go to **All Sites**, **Edit** each site, then select the tab **MultilingualPress** to configure the settings. You
need at least two sites with an assigned language.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will MultilingualPress translate my content?

No, it will not. It manages relationships between sites and translations, but it doesn't change the content.

### Where can I get additional language files?

You can find all official translation files in the according
[GlotPress project](http://translate.marketpress.com/projects/plugins/multilingualpress).

### Can I use MultilingualPress on a single-site installation?

That would require changes to the way WordPress stores post content. Other plugins do that; we think this is wrong,
because it creates a lock-in: you would lose access to your content after the plugin deactivation.
